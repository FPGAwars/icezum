## FTDI eeprom memory

The **FTDI chip** included in the Icezum Alhambra board has an internal **256 bytes eeprom memory** that is flashed in the factory. It can be flashed using the ftdi-eeprom **open source tool**. This tool can be compiled to any platform following the instruction of the [tool-systems apio package](https://github.com/FPGAwars/tools-system)

**NOTE**
Since May-15th-2019, the ftdi_eeprom tools has been included into the [APIO](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio) system tool v1.1.1 package. It can be execute by means of the apio raw command. For example, try:  **apio raw "ftdi_eeprom --help"**

### Flashing the eeprom

**NOTE**: Do not play with the FTDI eeprom memory unless you know what you are doing. If you change the product id string, Icestudio will not recognized it as an FPGA board and will not upload the bitstreams. **Use at your own risk**

* **Step 1**: Build the eeprom image from the config file

  * Edit the Alhambra1.conf file
  * Make your changes
  * Build the new eeprom image using the command:

```
$ apio raw "ftdi_eeprom --build-eeprom Alhambra1.conf"

FTDI eeprom generator v0.17
(c) Intra2net AG and the libftdi developers <opensource@intra2net.com>
FTDI read eeprom: 0
EEPROM size: 256
Used eeprom space: 254 bytes
Writing to file: A1-eeprom-image.bin
FTDI close: 0
```
The file **A1-eeprom-image.bin** will be generated

* **Step 2**: Flash the eeprom image

```
$ apio raw "ftdi_eeprom --flash-eeprom Alhambra1.conf"

FTDI eeprom generator v0.17
(c) Intra2net AG and the libftdi developers <opensource@intra2net.com>
FTDI read eeprom: 0
EEPROM size: 256
Used eeprom space: 254 bytes
FTDI write eeprom: 0
Writing to file: A1-eeprom-image.bin
FTDI close: 0
```

* **Step 3**: Testing the changes

If you have changed the manufacturer or product ids, you can check the changes using apio:

```
$ apio system --lsftdi
Number of FTDI devices found: 1
Checking device: 0
Manufacturer: CHANGED, Description: IceZUM Alhambra v1.1 - B02-059
```
## Restoring the eeprom

The **A1-eeprom-image-orig.bin** file contains an original eeprom image. You can restore it using the following command

```
$ apio raw "ftdi_eeprom --flash-eeprom Alhambra1-flash-orig.conf"

FTDI eeprom generator v0.17
(c) Intra2net AG and the libftdi developers <opensource@intra2net.com>
FTDI read eeprom: 0
EEPROM size: 256
Used eeprom space: 238 bytes
Flashing raw eeprom from file A1-eeprom-image-orig.bin (256 bytes)
FTDI write eeprom: 0
FTDI close: 0
```

## Reading the eeprom

If you are curious and want to have a look a your eeprom's image, you can read it with the following command:

```
$  apio raw "ftdi_eeprom --read-eeprom Alhambra1.conf"

FTDI eeprom generator v0.17
(c) Intra2net AG and the libftdi developers <opensource@intra2net.com>
FTDI read eeprom: 0
EEPROM size: 256
FTDI close: 0
```
It will generate the **A1-eeprom-image.bin** image. Then you can have a look with the hd command line in linux:

```
$ hd -v A1-eeprom-image.bin
